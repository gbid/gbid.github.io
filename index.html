  <h1>Gunther Bidlingmaier</h1>
  <p>
    I am Gunther, a Software Engineer based in Munich.
    My journey in tech and Computer Science has taken me from being a Researcher at the Technical University of Munich's Chair of Algorithms and Complexity to getting onto the hype train of AI and founding my own Web App for creating and optimizing job applications using AI.
    In my free time, I enjoy playing the French horn at <a href="https://junge-muenchner-symphoniker.de/">Junge MÃ¼nchner Symphoniker</a> [Young Munich Symphony Orchestra] and doing outdoor sports.

  <h2>Work Experience</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Founder, <a href="https://bewerbungshelfer.net">Bewerbungshelfer.net</a></strong> (January 2024 - present)<br>
      I launched Bewerbungshelfer.net, a platform designed to help users create and optimize job applications using Large Language Models. From designing and developing the app to handling deployment and advertising, I've been involved in every step of the process. Technologies used include Rust (5000 LoC), Axum, PostgreSQL, Typescript (5000 LoC) and React.js.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Software Engineer, CTO Taskforce at Check24 GmbH</strong> (September 2023 - January 2024)<br>
      At Check24, I worked closely with the CTO to build new server infrastructure for our core product in the car insurance sector using Ansible and Kubernetes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Researcher, <a href="https://www14.in.tum.de/index.html.en">Chair of Algorithms and Complexity</a>, TU Munich</strong> (2021 - 2023)<br>
      My research focused on improving algorithms for scheduling problems.
      I designed and implemented a more efficient, and much more elegant greedy algorithm for a fundamental scheduling problem which reduced the running time of the fastest known algorithm from O(n^3d^3) to O(n d).
      I also enjoyed teaching courses on Probability Theory and Advanced Algorithms.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Working Student, BMW AG</strong> (April 2018 - March 2019)<br>
      At BMW, I helped develop several web applications and a unified API for internal IT systems.
      This role gave me the opportunity to work with a diverse international team and a variety of technologies.
    </li>
  </ul>
