  <h1>Gunther Bidlingmaier</h1>
  <p>
    I am Gunther, a Software Engineer based in Munich.
    My journey in tech and Computer Science has taken me from being a Researcher at the Technical University of Munich to getting onto the AI hype train by founding my own AI startup.
    Instead of just boasting with AI buzzwords, I strive to leverage Large Language Models to build tools that are actually useful and solve real problems.
    In my free time, I enjoy playing the French horn at <a href="https://junge-muenchner-symphoniker.de/">Junge M端nchner Symphoniker</a> [Young Munich Symphony Orchestra] and doing outdoor sports.
