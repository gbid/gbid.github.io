    <h1>Gunther Bidlingmaier</h1>
    <p>
      I am Gunther, a Software Engineer based in Munich. My journey in Computer Science has taken me from working as a student at BMW AG to being a Researcher at the Technical University of Munich's Chair of Algorithms and Complexity.
      With a strong foundation in Computer Science and an appetite for learning new technologies, I am committed to creating practical and effective solutions that stand the test of time.
      If you are interested in hiring me as a Software Engineer, feel free to reach out to me via email:

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Researcher, <a href=https://www14.in.tum.de/index.html.en>Chair of Algorithms and Complexity</a>, TU Munich</strong> (2021 - 2023)<br>
        My research focused on energy-efficient scheduling of parallel processors.
        I developed a greedy algorithm for this long-standing problem, simplifying understanding and implementation compared to previous solutions, while reducing the running time from roughly O(n³ d³) to O(nd).
        I consistently strive for simple solutions that are easily comprehended and hence more likely to be implemented correctly.
        For the curious, the research paper is available on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00949">arXiv</a>, and the Rust implementation can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/gbid">GitHub profile</a>.
        As a researcher, I also taught Computer Science students in a Bachelor's level course on Probability Theory and a Master's level course on Advanced Algorithms.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Working Student, BMW AG</strong> (April 2018 - March 2019)<br>
        At BMW, I contributed to the development of a unified API for data endpoints within BMW IT systems. I implemented user verification and developed several web applications. I worked in an international team distributed between South Africa and Munich, gaining experience with a wide range of technologies.
